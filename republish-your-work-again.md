<h1 data-task-number="11">Republish your work again</h1>

> In this task, you'll use GitHub Pages to re-publish your work to the web.

Now update your published site. If you're not sure how, have a look back at the earlier publishing steps: [Publish your code to the web](/publish-your-code-to-the-web.html) and [Republish your work to the web](/republish-your-work-to-the-web.html).

You'll need to do a `git merge` to bring your changes in to your `gh-pages` branch before you `git push`.
