> Use JavaScript to show a message when some numbers match.

Now that your page has three different random numbers, sometimes they'll match. Write some JavaScript that checks if any of numbers match.

## Highlighting

Highlight the numbers that are the matching ones by

* using JS to add a class (for example, `highlight`) to the correct `div`s in the HTML;
* adding styles in your CSS file that use your new class(es) (try changing the `color`, `background-color`, `border`, and more!).

For adding and removing classes, have a look at:

  * [className](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className)
  * [classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

## Messaging

Display a message under the numbers that says

* what the matched numbers were;
* how many matches there were.

## Add files and push them to GitHub

To add all the files that have changed at once, you can use:

{% highlight bash %}
git add .
{% endhighlight %}
