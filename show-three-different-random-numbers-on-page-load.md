# Show three different random numbers on page load

> In this task, you'll use HTML and JavaScript to add two more number blocks.

Move your JavaScript to an external file. The bottom of your `index.html` should look something like this:

```html
	<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

* Add two more `div`s each with a number inside, and one extra `div` to contain them all.
* Update your JavaScript to randomise the number in each of the three blocks to a number between 1 and 9.

Every time the page loads, you should see three new random numbers. Huzzah!
