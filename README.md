# Playing With Matches

We'll be making some web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have a quick look at [the web triangle](./web-triangle.md) for some information about the structure of web pages.

## First few tasks



## Short break from the JavaScript

Let's [publish your code to a website](publish-your-code-to-a-website.md) using GitHub Pages, so that you can easily demo your work.

Add a file called `index.html`. Inside it, make a list of links to the pages you made from task 1, 2, and 3. Add some CSS to make it look more interesting. You might want to look at [list-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style) and  [list-style-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type). In `task1.html`, `task2.html`, and `task3.html` add a (hyper)link back to `index.html`.

Let's learn a bit more about another part of git: [ignoring files](gitignore.md).

## Short break from the JavaScript

Update your `index.html` to link to your task 4, 5, and 6 pages. Remember to add a link to `task4.html`, `task5.html`, and `task6.html` that links back to `index.html`.  

Now let's [republish your work to the web](republish-your-work-to-the-web.md) using GitHub Pages.
