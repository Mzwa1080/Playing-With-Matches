# Playing With Matches :fire:

We'll be making some web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have a quick look at [the web triangle](./web-triangle.md) for some information about the structure of web pages.

Step by step, we're going to build up a page that shows a series of random numbers, checks for matches, and shows a message, like this:

Work your work through these steps.

1. [Show a number](./show-a-number.md).
* [Show a random number on page load](./show-a-random-number-on-page-load.md).
* [Show three different random numbers on page load](./show-three-different-random-numbers-on-page-load.md).
* Show a message when two or more random numbers match.
* [Publish your code to the web](./publish-your-code-to-the-web.md).
* Add a button that shows a new set of random numbers.
* Show three rows of random numbers, with a button controlling each row.
* Show a message when two or more numbers on the same row match.
* Use just one button to control all the rows.
* [Republish your work to the web](./republish-your-work-to-the-web.md).
* Show a message when two or more numbers on the same row or column match.
* Show a message when two or more numbers on the same row, column, or diagonal match.
