# Playing With Matches :fire:

We'll be making a web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's have a look at how these three pieces fit together.

![web triangle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1239497/12510480/cf92cf68-c112-11e5-91c5-7d55024bf083.png)

The structure of every web page looks a bit like this. It's a triangle because the balance should mostly be like that: lots of HTML, quite a lot of CSS, and as little JavaScript as possible.

At the base you have your **HTML**. It's the **structured content** of the page: headings, paragraphs, images, videos.

On top of that you have your **CSS**. This handles the **presentation**: colours, fonts, layout. Note that it's a separate layer: see, there's a line there and everything. It exists apart from the structure and content (the HTML) of the page.

At the very top, in the tiny triangle, is the **JavaScript** (JS). This adds behaviour and interactions to the page. It's the most fragile part of the three. An error in the code (perhaps introduced at midnight by a sleepy developer as a "quick fix") can break the whole block of the JS.

* [Show a message when two or more random numbers match](show-a-message-when-two-or-more-random-numbers-match.md).
* [Publish your code to the web](./publish-your-code-to-the-web.md).
* [Add a button that shows a new set of random numbers](add-a-button-that-shows-a-new-set-of-random-numbers.md).
* [Add more rows and update the message](add-more-rows-and-update-the-message.md).
* [Republish your work to the web](./republish-your-work-to-the-web.md).
