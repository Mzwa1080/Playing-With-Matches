# Playing With Matches :fire:

We'll be making some web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have a quick look at [the web triangle](./web-triangle.md) for some information about the structure of web pages.

Step by step, we're going to build up a page that shows a series of random numbers, checks for matches, and shows a message, like this:

![matches](./img/matches.jpg)

Work your work through these steps.

1. [Show a number](./show-a-number.md).
* [Show a random number on page load](./show-a-random-number-on-page-load.md).
* [Show three different random numbers on page load](./show-three-different-random-numbers-on-page-load.md).
* [Show a message when two or more random numbers match](show-a-message-when-two-or-more-random-numbers-match.md).
* [Publish your code to the web](./publish-your-code-to-the-web.md).
* [Add a button that shows a new set of random numbers](add-a-button that-shows-a-new-set-of-random-numbers.md).
* [Add more rows and update the message](add-more-rows-and-update-the-message.md).
* [Republish your work to the web](./republish-your-work-to-the-web.md).
* [Show a message when two or more numbers on the same row or column match](show-a-message-when-two-or-more-numbers-on-the-same-row-or-column-match.md).
* [Show a message when two or more numbers on the same row, column, or diagonal match](show-a-message-when-two-or-more-numbers-on-the-same-row-column-or-diagonal-match.md).
